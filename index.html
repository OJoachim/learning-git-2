			<h1>More Than Words...</h1>
			<h2>by <span>Extreme</span></h2>
			<p>Saying I love you<br/>is not the words I want to hear from you<br/>It's not that I want you<br/>not to say but if you only knew<br/>Ho-ow ea-sy it would be to show me how you feel<br/>More than words is all you have to do to make it real<br/>Then you wouldn't have to say<br/>That you love me 'cause<br/>I'd already know<br/></p>
			<p>What would you do if my heart was torn in two<br/>More than words to show you feel<br/>that your love for me is real<br/>What would you say if I took those words away?<br/>Then you couldn't make things new<br/>Just by saying I love you<br/>More than words...</p>
			<p>Now I've tried to talk<br/>to you and make you understand<br/>All you have to do is close your eyes<br/>And just reach out your hands<br/>And touch me<br/>Hold me close don't ever let me go<br/>More than words is all I ever needed you to show<br/>Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me<br/>Cause I'd already know<br/></p>
			<p>What would you do if my heart was torn in two<br/>More than words to show you feel<br/>that your love for me is real<br/>What would you say if I took those words away?<br/>Then you couldn't make things new<br/>Just by saying I love you<br/>More than words...</p>
